# Automatic Snapshots for Google (gcloud) Compute Engine

Bash script for Automatic Snapshots and Cleanup on Google Compute Engine. **Requires no user input!**

Inspiration (and the installation instructions) taken from AWS script [aws-ec2-ebs-automatic-snapshot-bash](https://github.com/CaseyLabs/aws-ec2-ebs-automatic-snapshot-bash)

## How it works
gcloud-snapshot.sh will:

- Determine the Instance ID of the Google Compute Engine server on which the script runs
- Get all the Disk IDs attached to that instance
- Take a snapshot of each Disk
- The script will then delete all associated snapshots taken by the script for the Instance that are older than 7 days (optional: [default snapshot retention can be changed by using -d flag](#snapshot-retention))


## Prerequisites
* `cURL` must be installed
* The VM must have the sufficient gcloud permissions, including "compute" set to "enabled":

* The version of gcloud is up to date: `gcloud components update` 
* You are authenticated with gcloud - normally this happens automatically, but some users get the error "Insufficient Permission" and need to authenticate: `sudo gcloud auth login`

## Installation

ssh on to the server you wish to have backed up

**Install Script**: Download the latest version of the snapshot script and make it executable:
```
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacksegal/google-compute-snapshot/master/gcloud-snapshot.sh
chmod +x gcloud-snapshot.sh
sudo mkdir -p /opt/google-compute-snapshot
sudo mv gcloud-snapshot.sh /opt/google-compute-snapshot/
```

**To manually test the script:**
```
sudo /opt/google-compute-snapshot/gcloud-snapshot.sh
```

## Automation

**Setup CRON**: You should then setup a cron job in order to schedule a daily backup. Example cron for Debian based Linux:
```
0 5 * * * root /opt/google-compute-snapshot/gcloud-snapshot.sh >> /var/log/cron/snapshot.log 2>&1
```

Please note: the above command sends the output to a log file: `/var/log/cron/snapshot.log` - instructions for creating & managing the log file are below.

**Manage CRON Output**: You should then create a directory for all cron outputs and add it to logrotate:

- Create new directory:
``` 
sudo mkdir /var/log/cron 
```
- Create empty file for snapshot log:
```
sudo touch /var/log/cron/snapshot.log
```
- Change permissions on file:
```
sudo chgrp adm /var/log/cron/snapshot.log
sudo chmod 664 /var/log/cron/snapshot.log
```
- Create new entry in logrotate so cron files don't get too big :
```
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/cron
```
- Add the following text to the above file:
```
/var/log/cron/*.log {
    daily
    missingok
    rotate 14
    compress
    notifempty
    create 664 root adm
    sharedscripts
}
```

## Usage Options

```
Usage:

./gcloud-snapshot.sh [-d <days>] [-t <label_name>] [-T <gcloud_filter_expression>] [-i <instance_name>] [-z <instance_zone>] [-p <prefix>] [-a <service_account>]

Options:

    -d    Number of days to keep snapshots.  Snapshots older than this number deleted.
          Default if not set: 7 [OPTIONAL]
    -t    Only back up disks that have this specified label with value set to 'true'.
    -T    Only back up disks returned from querying with this filter. Uses gcloud filter expressions
          If both -t and -T are used, both terms are joined by the operator AND
    -i    Instance name to create backups for. If empty, makes backup for the calling
          host.
    -z    Instance zone. If empty, uses the zone of the calling host.
    -p    Prefix to be used for naming snapshots, default to 'gcs'
    -a    Service Account to use. If empty, it uses the gcloud default.
```

### Snapshot Retention
By default snapshots will be kept for 7 days, however they can be kept for longer / shorter, by using the the -d flag:

    Usage: ./snapshot.sh [-d <days>]
    
    Options:
    
       -d  Number of days to keep snapshots. Snapshots older than this number deleted.
           Default if not set: 7 [OPTIONAL]

### Matching on specific disks
By default, snapshots will be created for all attached disks.  To only snapshot specific disks (ie. data volumes while skipping boot volumes), use the -t flag:

    Usage: ./gcloud-snapshot.sh [-t <label>]
    
    Options:
    
       -t  Only back up disks that have this specified label with value set to 'true'

Example: If you set the label to "auto_snapshot", only disks matching this key/value pair will be snapshotted:

    auto_snapshot=true

Use -T for a more flexible way to specify the disks to snapshot.
    Usage: ./gcloud-compute-snapshot.sh [-T <gcloud_filter_expression>]

    Options:

       -T    Only back up disks returned from querying with this filter. Uses gcloud filter expressions"
             If both -t and -T are used, both terms are joined by the operator AND"

Example: `./gcloud-compute-snapshot.sh -t auto_snapshot -T "sizeGb = 10 AND name: ubuntu"`. Attached disks matching this expression will be snapshotted

    --format="labels.auto_snapshot=true AND sizeGb = 10 AND name: ubuntu"

This also allows you to bake snapshotting into your Google images by setting a cron job with a label on every image you create, and then you can set a label on the volumes you want to snapshot in your infrastructure management tool (Terraform) to selectively snapshot them.

### Choosing instance for the attached disks
By default, all the disks attached to the calling instance will be snapshotted. To change this behaviour:

    ./gcloud-compute-snapshot.sh [-i <instance_name]

    Note: The calling instance (rather than the named instance) needs to have the correct gcloud permissions

### Choosing zone
By default, the zone of the calling instance is used. To change this behaviour:

    ./gcloud-compute-snapshot.sh [-z <zone>]

    Note: Even if an instance is named with `-i`, the zone of the calling instance is used

### Snapshot names
By default, snapshots are created with names in the format of `prefix-diskName-instanceId-unixTimestamp`. To give a custom prefix:

    ./gcloud-compute-snapshot.sh [-p <prefix>]

    Note: Snapshot names are limited to 62 characters.
